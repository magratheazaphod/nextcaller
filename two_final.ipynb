    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "For this human-guided machine learning problem, the challenge was to settle on useful user-created variables that could help to predict whether a URL was correctly linked with an institution of higher learning, or whether it was an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "I created three types of variables based on institution names to predict potential URLs: Potential acronyms, Keywords, and potential abbreviations. These variables were tested extensively in the scratch notebooks two_scratch and two_scratch_2, with key results documented here. In each case, I generate a list of possible substrings contained in the institution's URL, and then create variables that show whether any of them appear in the actual URL. These latter variables are used to predict whether a URL is correct. If any of the three match the URL then we set the predictor matched_url to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "I began working on this problem with the intention of using a logistic regression model to generate probabilities, but I quickly realized both that my generated variables were skilled at finding whether urls matched institution names or not, and also that the variables I generated were highly correlated - almost every machine learning method requires a linearly independent basis of variables, which I was never going to have in my problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Details\n",
    "All of acronyms, keywords and abbreviations consisted of lists with different potential permutations that might appear in URLs. In particular, I found from perusing the data that many institution names consisted of a central university followed by a local branch, while the URL would only contain the central university's name. Therefore, I generated potential acronyms in which the final or final two letters were omitted (ostensibly corresponding to place names). The downside, especially with two-letter acronyms, is the potential for false positives, but the improvement in matching seemed to justify the risk. Using simple acronyms correctly predicted 67/100 training results versus 68/100 with an enhanced set of acronyms, so perhaps the additional complexity is not warranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Using all 3 types of variables, I am able to find a link to 90.8% of all institutions in the database of accredited centers of higher learning (where almost all URLs are correctly associated), and correctly predict whether 96/100 potential URLs in the training set really belong to the listed institution or not. A further visual inspection of the accredited institution database suggests that many of the remaining URLs were not really guessable from institution names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this notebook to test an arbitrary set of institution names and URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way is to load in your data as a dataframe (e.g. `test_df = pd.read_csv('testFile.csv')`) and then add the new dataframe to the list dfs in the third cell (`dfs = [accred_df, sample_df, test_df]`). All user-defined variables will automatically be added to this dataframe, as well as eventual prediction from both direct estimate and from logistic regression. I'm happy to write some other interface if that seems too complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've also saved the results from this analysis as a pickle file stored in this github repository (two_accred.pkl, two_sample.pkl and two_test.pkl).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Remaining Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "I am curious about the risk of false positives that comes with generating larger lists of potential acronyms and abbreviations. In test notebook two_scratch_2, I found that adding possible abbreviations increased the percentage of predicted URLs in the accredited institution database from 89.0% to 91.3%, but that database also does not contain any incorrect matches."

I originally started out with just the acronym created by taking all capitalized words, which I saved in each dataframe as the variable 'acronym'. However, I found that many schools consist of a core university name and then a location specifier (e.g. California State University - East Bay). In the end, I wound up creating up to 5 possible acronyms per institution: 1) Every capital; 2) Drop first letter; 3) Drop last letter; 4) Drop last two letter (many cities are two words); and 5) Acronym from first letter of every word, even conjunctions. The improvements from the last two were pretty marginal and number 4 may lead to more false positives, but I found repeated instances where including extra acronyms helped to find a correspondence with a URL."

In fact, this is pretty problematic for trying to perform any kind of logistic regression since individual variables are supposed to be independent (I'll give it a shot anyway). Abbreviations only offer a marginal extra bit that keywords do not, while a url is very unlikely to combine both an acronym and a keyword/abbreviation."

The training set is also small enough that I didn't feel that I could gain a lot of information on how to tune my model (i.e. how aggressively to generate potential acronyms, for instance). I also failed to generate a probability of accuracy as requested in part b, but essentially my predictions are strongly bimodal - if there is a match with the url then I find it is very likely to be the correct url, and likewise if there is no match.\n",
